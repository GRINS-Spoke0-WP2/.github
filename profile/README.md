This organisation has been created within the GRINS project to take trace of the scripts used for generating the deliverable of the projects. Several repositories are available and extensive descriptions are contained within each of them. Within the same repo, there are several versions of scripts (*v.0.0.1* or *v.1.0.0* etc.) that generate respective versions of dataset.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# Final Goal

The goal of the GRINS (Growing Resiliant INclusive and Sustainable) project is to help the Italian community to grow efficiently as well as resilient, inclusive and sustainable. This important and challenging goal will be reached thank to the deeper comprehension of the reality. Data are the mirror of reality, but they must be collected, validated, re-organised, harmonised, analysed, visualised and finally interpreted. Statistical tools are the only instruments capable of performing these operations on the data, so they are indispensable for achieving the goals of the GRINS project.

The team of the University of Bergamo (UNIBG) involved in the spoke 0, more specifically in the Work Package 0.2 (WP0.2), leaded by Prof. Alessandro Fass√≤, is proposing to use a common methodology for data harmonisation among the groups of the project. In particular, these methods are suitable for spatial and temporal data. UNIBG works mainly with environmental data: weather, air quality and emissions. Harmonised data, with the same spatial and temporal resolution (i.e. municipality and daily), will compose the dataset used by the AMELIA platform. More specifically, this dataset will represent the deliverable D.0.2.1 of the GRINS project.

# Data Import

Environmental data can be available from many different sources, therefore the first task is to identify the sources to be used. For example, environmental data can be observed by land monitoring stations or can be measured by satellites, or can be produced by mathematical models. More over there are several different organisations who manage the release of these data, with different procedures. A common advantage of environmental data, compared to economic or social data, is the fact that they usually are collected for communities and research purposes therefore they are often deliver without any fees. The download and management of this kind of data require several R routines to automatise the process: from the download to the final dataset. Different acronyms indicate different dimensions: **AQ** for Air Quality, **WE** for Weather, **EM** for Emissions.

## Repositories
1. **AQ-EEA** contains the data flow for air quality measurements obtained by the European Environmental Agency.
2. **AQ-CAMS** contains the data flow for air quality numerical models output obtained by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).
3. **WE-C3S** contains the data flow for weather data obtained by the Climate Change Service (C3S).
4. **EM-CAMS** contains the data flow for emission data obtained by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).

# Modelling

To reach the ultimate goal of the GRINS project, we need an harmonised dataset at municipal level, daily, containing all the variables considered. However, while administrative data come naturally at municipal level, environmental data can have different resolutions, as points-referenced or grids, but almost never at municipal level. We decided to tackle this problem using a statistical approach. Different models are considered: Hidden Dynamic Geostatistical Model (HDGM), Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK), and other models are under investigation.
